Just Budget is a simple and straightforward to use budget management tool. Plan your monthly spending by entering your income and expenses, Just Budget will then calculate how much money you will have by the end of the month. Just Budget also allows you to track and view your spending from previous months, so you would never have to wonder where youâ€™ve spent your money again!

# Installing & Deploying Just Budget Locally
1. To run this application on your own computer, you will first need to install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install).
2. Once Meteor is installed, download the Just Budget project from GitHub as a ZIP file.
3. Extract the content of the ZIP file, from there open command prompt and run these commands:
```
cd app
```
```
meteor npm install
```
4. Once the program has finished installing the necessary packages, you can run this command to deploy the application:
```
meteor npm run start
```
Which should produce the following output:
```
PS C:\Users\chakh\Documents\GitHub\just-budget\app> meteor npm run start

> meteor-application-template-react@ start C:\Users\chakh\Documents\GitHub\just-budget\app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

# Uninstall Just Budget

# Developer notes
- We use [meteor-application-template-react](http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/) as a template for out project
- For the release of Just Budget we removed the send email from the Feedback page due to security reasons, if you were to deploy Just Budget the email feature will _**NOT**_ work.
- The feedback email is a proof of concept on how we could maintain the project and response to future threats.
- The admin page did not implement as planned due to security reasons. Since we are using meteor for our application, meteor's default is that users would not able to modify or delete an account on the client-side, the function calls ```Meteor.users.remove()``` where prohibited because meteor does not want to take any security risks since this function call might mess up the database if there is vulnerability. So we decide to add an option on the feedback page, where users can make a request to delete their account. If we deployed the application, once we receive the request, we will manually log on to the Mongo database and remove the account information from the database.
- To reset the application, open command prompt where the application located and run these commands:
```
cd app
meteor reset
```
